# Sakila Database — SQL Business Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the Sakila database using SQL to analyze rental revenue, film performance, customer spending, and monthly business activity.

Through five business-oriented SQL queries, the project demonstrates how relational data can be transformed into meaningful insights to support business analysis and decision-making.

The analysis covers monthly revenue trends, the highest-revenue film categories, the most frequently rented films, top-spending customers, and film rankings within selected categories.

A key focus of this project is the use of **Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions** to rank films by revenue within individual categories.

## Project Objectives

* Analyze monthly revenue trends over time.
* Identify the five film categories generating the highest revenue.
* Determine the ten most frequently rented films.
* Identify the ten customers with the highest total spending.
* Rank the top three films by revenue within the Action and Comedy categories.

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL**
* **SQLite**
* **Sakila relational database**

## Database Overview

Sakila is a sample database representing a DVD rental business. It contains information about films, categories, inventory, rentals, payments, and customers.

This project focuses on the following tables:

| Table           | Purpose                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `payment`       | Payment transactions and amounts           |
| `category`      | Film category information                  |
| `film_category` | Relationships between films and categories |
| `film`          | Film titles and related information        |
| `inventory`     | Film copies available for rental           |
| `rental`        | Rental transactions                        |
| `customer`      | Customer information                       |

These tables are joined to connect rental activity with payment records, allowing the analysis to examine revenue and rental performance across different business dimensions.
